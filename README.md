# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

My goal with this project was to create a front end site where users can play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against a computer with randomised choices. I also wanted to create a Home page to explain the rules clearly to the user.

This site is targeted towards people who are fans of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors and want to try a more complex version of the game. It is also targeted towards fans of the Big Bang Theory TV show who discovered the game through the show and wanted to try it for themselves.

## Planning

### Wireframes

For my planning I created wireframes for my Home and Play pages.

I used the wireframes as a template to help me write the HTML and CSS code for each page.

### Flowchart

I also created a flowchart of how the game will work.

I used this flowchart as a template to help me write the JavaScript for the game.
